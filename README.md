# WebScraper
Tooling around with Selenium WebDriver for various tasks. Web scraping, job 
application filling, etc...

# Run Steps

Currently, just creating python files per each different task to run as a module.
Each function details steps for running through the webpage and grabbing information.

To run the basic linkedin job scrape, either run scrape_methods.py or load that file
and run the function "linkedin_newpostings()"
